If not already present, make an "autoload" directory in $VIMRUNTIME.
Put DoTagStuff.vim in your autoload directory.

In your vimrc, add (if you don't already have something similar):

     " Auto-load functions on an as-needed basis.
     autocmd FuncUndefined *	exe 'runtime autoload/' . expand('<afile>') . '.vim'

For whatever languages you want, add to or create a syntax "after" file; e.g.:

...vim/after/syntax/c.vim
...vim/after/syntax/perl.vim

Samples have been included in the package.

The "find_tagstuff" perl script needs to be put someplace on your path, or
hardcode the full path to it in the DoTagStuff.vim script.  This script will
create files starting with ".vim" (so they won't normally be seen), that are
little vim scripts that get sourced to set syntax highlighting.

NOTES:
     You *must* include the --fields option to ctags that includes "language of
     source file containing tag" (i.e., "--fields=l" ; I use --fields+=Kl)
     ctags option to include the language type in the tags file.  This is
     needed to properly form syntax groups (e.g., cStaticFunction or
     perlExternalFunction).

     This stuff was rather quickly extracted from our working environment, and
     edited to try and remove most of our environment-specific settings.  It
     all works fine in our environment, and I *think* I've included all the
     pieces here, but it hasn't been tested in this form.

     All this was designed for a Linux environment; no guarantees on behavior
     under Windows.
