If not already present, make an "autoload" directory in $VIMRUNTIME.
Put DoTagStuff.vim in your autoload directory.

In your vimrc, add (if you don't already have something similar):

     " Auto-load functions on an as-needed basis.
     autocmd FuncUndefined *	exe 'runtime autoload/' . expand('<afile>') . '.vim'

For whatever languages you want, add to or create a syntax "after" file; e.g.:

...vim/after/syntax/c.vim
...vim/after/syntax/perl.vim

Samples have been included in the package.

The "find_tagstuff" perl script needs to be put someplace on your path, or
hardcode the full path to it in the DoTagStuff.vim script.  This script will
create files starting with ".vim" (so they won't normally be seen), that are
little vim scripts that get sourced to set syntax highlighting.

Note that this stuff was rather quickly extracted from our working environment,
and edited to try and remove most of our environment-specific settings.  It all
works fine in our environment, and I *think* I've included all the pieces here,
but it hasn't been tested in this form.

Note also that it was all designed for a Linux environment; no guarantees on
behavior under Windows.
