Extract information from a tags file (exuberant ctags), and generate syntax highlighting scripts for functions, globals, macros, etc.

Somewhat "raw" extraction from my working environment; i.e., not particularly generic; e.g., hard-coded color settings for the various types of tokens identified (functions, macros, etc.).  Easily changed, but by editing the c.vim included that is intended to go in your "after/syntax" vim directory.

*Not* very polished, but perhaps helpful.

For a sample of the results, see:  http://castandcrew.com/~gary/DoTagStuff/

NOTE: You *must* include the --fields option to ctags that includes "language of source file containing tag" (i.e., "--fields=l" ; I use --fields=+Kl).  It's needed so that  the language type of each tag is included in the tags file.  This is needed to properly form syntax groups (e.g., cStaticFunction or perlExternalFunction -- to get the "c" or "perl" parts).
